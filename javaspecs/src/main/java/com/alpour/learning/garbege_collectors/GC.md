Garbage collection in Java is a crucial aspect of memory management. Java uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory, which helps in reclaiming the memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. This ensures that the application runs efficiently and prevents memory leaks.

## Types of Garbage Collectors in Java

1. **Serial Garbage Collector**:
    - **Description**: This is the simplest and oldest garbage collector in Java. It uses a single thread to handle all the garbage collection tasks.
    - **Use Case**: It's suitable for small applications with relatively low memory requirements.

2. **Parallel Garbage Collector**:
    - **Description**: Also known as the "Throughput Collector," this garbage collector uses multiple threads for parallel processing of garbage collection tasks.
    - **Use Case**: It's ideal for applications that require high throughput and can afford to stop-the-world pauses.

3. **CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) Garbage Collector**:
    - **Description**: This collector aims to minimize the pauses caused by garbage collection by performing most of its work concurrently with the application threads.
    - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications that require low pause times and can tolerate some degree of concurrent execution overhead.

4. **G1 (Garbage-First) Garbage Collector**:
    - **Description**: G1 divides the heap into regions and collects garbage in a mixed manner (both young and old generations). It aims to meet a specified pause time target with high predictability.
    - **Use Case**: It is designed for applications that require predictable pause times and have large heap sizes.

5. **ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)**:
    - **Description**: ZGC is designed to handle very large heaps with minimal pause times. It performs most of its work concurrently and aims for sub-millisecond pause times.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications that require extremely low latency and can operate with large heap sizes.

6. **Shenandoah Garbage Collector**:
    - **Description**: Similar to ZGC, Shenandoah aims to provide low pause times by performing concurrent garbage collection tasks.
    - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications that require low pause times and have high memory footprint requirements.

## How Garbage Collection Works

1. **Marking**:
    - The garbage collector identifies which objects are still in use and which are no longer needed.

2. **Normal Deletion**:
    - Objects that are no longer in use are deleted, freeing up memory space.

3. **Compaction**:
    - The heap is reorganized to eliminate fragmentation, making allocation of new objects more efficient.

## Benefits of Garbage Collection

- **Automatic Memory Management**: Reduces the burden on developers to manually manage memory.
- **Prevention of Memory Leaks**: Helps in preventing memory leaks by reclaiming unused objects.
- **Improved Performance**: Ensures efficient use of memory, leading to better application performance.

Do you want to dive deeper into any specific garbage collector or discuss how to tune them for optimal performance?

Great! Let's dive into some details for tuning and optimizing garbage collectors in Java.

## Tuning the Garbage Collectors

    - Shenandoah is designed for low pause times, so minimal tuning is usually required.
    - Monitor the application's performance and adjust heuristics if necessary.

## General Tips for All Garbage Collectors
1. **Heap Size**:
    - Ensure that the heap size is large enough to accommodate your application's memory requirements. Adjust it using `-Xms` (initial heap size) and `-Xmx` (maximum heap size) parameters.

2. **Monitoring and Profiling**:
    - Use tools like VisualVM, JConsole, and Java Flight Recorder to monitor garbage collection behavior and identify bottlenecks.
    - Regularly profile your application to understand its memory usage patterns and adjust garbage collection settings accordingly.

3. **GC Logs**:
    - Enable garbage collection logging using `-Xlog:gc*` to analyze garbage collection events and performance.
    - Review logs to identify frequent full GC events and optimize the collector settings to mitigate them.

4. **Application-Specific Tuning**:
    - Understand your application's memory usage patterns, such as object allocation rates and longevity.
    - Tune garbage collector settings based on the application's specific needs, such as reducing pause times or improving throughput.

By carefully tuning these parameters and monitoring your application's behavior, you can optimize the performance of the Java garbage collectors to suit your needs. If you have specific scenarios or performance issues you'd like to discuss, feel free to share!


Yes, you can set different garbage collectors (GC) for each Java application even if they are running on the same operating system with the same Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installation. Each Java application runs in its own Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instance, and you can configure the JVM options independently for each application.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Set JVM Options for Application 1**:
   Suppose you want to use the G1 Garbage Collector for the first application. You can set the JVM options when starting the application like this:
   ```sh
   java -XX:+UseG1GC -jar application1.jar
   ```

2. **Set JVM Options for Application 2**:
   For the second application, if you want to use the Parallel Garbage Collector, you can set the JVM options like this:
   ```sh
   java -XX:+UseParallelGC -jar application2.jar
   ```

Each command specifies the garbage collector to be used for that particular application. The JVM options passed via the command line are specific to the JVM instance for the respective application, allowing you to have different GC settings for each application.

Let me know if you need more details or if there's anything specific you'd like to explore!



## GC for every application

you can identify which garbage collector is being used by the JVM with several methods. Here are a couple of ways to do this:

#### Method 1: Using JVM Options
You can pass the `-XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags` option when starting your Java application to print the JVM command-line flags, which will include the garbage collector being used. For example:
```sh
java -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags -jar your-application.jar
```

The output will contain information about the garbage collector. For instance, you might see something like:
```
-XX:+UseG1GC
```

#### Method 2: Using Java Code
You can use the `ManagementFactory` class to programmatically determine which garbage collector is being used. Here's an example of how to do this:
```java
import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory;
import java.lang.management.GarbageCollectorMXBean;
import java.util.List;

public class GCIdentifier {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<GarbageCollectorMXBean> gcBeans = ManagementFactory.getGarbageCollectorMXBeans();
        for (GarbageCollectorMXBean gcBean : gcBeans) {
            System.out.println("Garbage Collector: " + gcBean.getName());
        }
    }
}
```
Running this code will print the names of the garbage collectors being used by the JVM.

#### Method 3: Analyzing GC Logs
You can enable garbage collection logging to see detailed information about the garbage collector being used. Use the following JVM options to enable GC logging:
```sh
java -Xlog:gc* -jar your-application.jar
```
The generated logs will provide detailed information about the garbage collection events, including the name of the garbage collector.

These methods should help you identify which garbage collector is being used by the JVM for your applications. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!



## Explain each GC

Let's explore each garbage collector one by one in detail, starting with the **Serial Garbage Collector**. I'll provide an overview, explain how it works, and then give an example to help you understand it better.

### 1. Serial Garbage Collector

**Overview**:
The Serial Garbage Collector is the simplest and oldest garbage collector in Java. It uses a single thread to handle all garbage collection tasks, making it a good choice for small applications with low memory requirements.

**How It Works**:
- The Serial Garbage Collector follows a "stop-the-world" approach, where it pauses all application threads during garbage collection.
- It performs garbage collection in three main phases: **Marking**, **Copying**, and **Compacting**.

**Phases**:
1. **Marking**: The collector identifies which objects are still in use.
2. **Copying**: It copies the live objects to a new space, leaving behind the dead objects.
3. **Compacting**: It compacts the heap to eliminate fragmentation and make the allocation of new objects more efficient.

**Example**:

Let's consider a simple Java application using the Serial Garbage Collector. We'll configure the JVM to use the Serial GC and analyze its behavior.

```java
public class SerialGCExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            // Create a large number of objects
            String[] array = new String[10000];
            for (int j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
                array[j] = new String("Object " + j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run the application with the Serial Garbage Collector enabled:
```sh
java -XX:+UseSerialGC -Xlog:gc* SerialGCExample
```

**Analyzing GC Logs**:
The GC logs will show how the Serial Garbage Collector is working. You will see entries like:
```
[GC (Allocation Failure) [DefNew: 2048K->256K(2048K), 0.0012345 secs] 2048K->256K(2048K), 0.0015678 secs] [Times: user=0.01 sys=0.00, real=0.01 secs]
```

Key Points:

- **DefNew** indicates the young generation space where garbage collection occurs.
- The numbers represent the memory usage before and after GC.
- **real=0.01 secs** shows the total pause time for the GC event.

Summary:

The Serial Garbage Collector is effective for applications with low memory requirements and single-threaded environments. Its simplicity and stop-the-world approach make it easy to understand and use.

Would you like to move on to the **Parallel Garbage Collector** next, or is there anything specific you want to delve deeper into with the Serial Garbage Collector?

#### How GC works

Let’s dive deeper into the **New Generation**, **Tenured Generation**, and **Metaspace** in the context of Java's memory management and garbage collection.

---

**1. New Generation (Young Generation)**

The **New Generation** is where newly created objects are allocated. It is divided into three parts:

**a. Eden Space**

- **Purpose**: This is where all new objects are initially allocated.
- **Behavior**: 
  - When Eden space fills up, a **Minor GC** (Young Generation GC) is triggered.
  - Most objects die young (short-lived), so they are cleaned up during this process.
- **Example**: In your log, Eden space was 100% full before GC, indicating a lot of short-lived object creation.

**b. Survivor Spaces (From and To)**

- **Purpose**: Objects that survive a Minor GC are moved to one of the two **Survivor Spaces**.
- **Behavior**:
  - Survivor spaces are used to hold objects that have survived at least one GC cycle but are not yet old enough to be moved to the Tenured Generation.
  - The "From" and "To" spaces alternate roles during each GC cycle.
- **Example**: In your log, only 2% of the "From" space was used, and the "To" space was empty. This suggests most objects in Eden were short-lived and did not survive to the survivor space.

**c. Aging and Promotion**

- Objects that survive multiple GC cycles in the Survivor Spaces are eventually promoted to the **Tenured Generation** (Old Generation).

---

**2. Tenured Generation (Old Generation)**

The **Tenured Generation** is where long-lived objects reside. These are objects that have survived multiple GC cycles in the New Generation.

**a. Purpose**

- Stores objects that have been around for a while and are expected to persist for the lifetime of the application.
- Examples include cached data, long-lived session objects, or static data.

**b. Behavior**

- When the Tenured Generation fills up, a **Major GC** (or **Full GC**) is triggered. This is more expensive and time-consuming than a Minor GC.
- In your log, the Tenured Generation has very low utilization (0%), which is a good sign. It means long-lived objects are not accumulating excessively.

**c. Monitoring**

- If the Tenured Generation grows too large, it could indicate a memory leak or inefficient object retention. This would eventually lead to frequent Full GCs, which can cause application pauses.

---

**3. Metaspace**

The **Metaspace** is a memory area introduced in Java 8 to replace the **PermGen** (Permanent Generation). It is used for storing metadata about classes and methods.

**a. Purpose**

- Stores class metadata, such as:
  - Class definitions.
  - Method definitions.
  - Bytecode.
  - Constant pool information.
- Unlike PermGen, Metaspace is not part of the Java heap and can grow dynamically (up to a limit).

**b. Behavior**

- **Used**: The amount of memory currently used for metadata.
- **Committed**: The amount of memory reserved by the JVM for metadata.
- **Reserved**: The total amount of memory available for metadata (can grow dynamically).
- In your log, Metaspace usage is stable (9586 KB used out of 9792 KB committed), indicating no significant class loading or unloading activity.

**c. Class Space**

- A subset of Metaspace dedicated to class metadata.
- In your log, Class Space usage is 1102 KB out of 1216 KB committed.

**d. Monitoring**

- If Metaspace usage grows unexpectedly, it could indicate a **class loader leak** (e.g., classes being loaded repeatedly without being unloaded). This can lead to `OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace`.

---

**4. How These Areas Work Together**

1. **Object Creation**:
   - New objects are created in the **Eden Space**.
   - If Eden fills up, a **Minor GC** occurs, and surviving objects are moved to the **Survivor Spaces**.

2. **Object Aging**:
   - Objects that survive multiple GC cycles in the Survivor Spaces are promoted to the **Tenured Generation**.

3. **Class Metadata**:
   - Metadata about classes and methods is stored in **Metaspace**.
   - This area is managed separately from the heap and can grow dynamically.

4. **Garbage Collection**:
   - **Minor GC**: Cleans up the New Generation (Eden and Survivor Spaces).
   - **Major/Full GC**: Cleans up the entire heap (New Generation and Tenured Generation) and can also involve Metaspace.

---

**5. Key Takeaways**

- **New Generation**:
  - Focuses on short-lived objects.
  - High Eden space usage is normal for applications that create many temporary objects.
  - Low Survivor space usage indicates most objects are short-lived.

- **Tenured Generation**:
  - Stores long-lived objects.
  - Low usage is good, but monitor for growth to avoid Full GCs.

- **Metaspace**:
  - Stores class metadata.
  - Stable usage is good, but unexpected growth could indicate class loader leaks.

Alright, let's delve into the **Parallel Garbage Collector**.

### 2. Parallel Garbage Collector

**Overview**:
The Parallel Garbage Collector, also known as the Throughput Collector, uses multiple threads to perform garbage collection tasks in parallel. This allows it to achieve higher throughput by reducing the pause times compared to the Serial Garbage Collector. It is ideal for applications that can afford stop-the-world pauses but need to handle large volumes of transactions.

**How It Works**:
- The Parallel Garbage Collector performs garbage collection in both the young and old generations using multiple threads.
- It follows a "stop-the-world" approach where all application threads are paused during garbage collection.

**Phases**:
1. **Young Generation Collection**:
    - **Minor GC**: Focuses on collecting and compacting objects in the young generation.
    - Uses multiple threads to scan and copy live objects.

2. **Old Generation Collection**:
    - **Major GC**: Focuses on collecting objects in the old generation.
    - Uses multiple threads to scan, mark, and compact objects.

**Example**:

Let's consider a Java application using the Parallel Garbage Collector. We'll configure the JVM to use the Parallel GC and analyze its behavior.

```java
public class ParallelGCExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            // Create a large number of objects
            String[] array = new String[10000];
            for (int j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
                array[j] = new String("Object " + j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run the application with the Parallel Garbage Collector enabled:
```sh
java -XX:+UseParallelGC -Xlog:gc* ParallelGCExample
```

**Analyzing GC Logs**:
The GC logs will show how the Parallel Garbage Collector is working. You will see entries like:
```
[GC (Allocation Failure) [PSYoungGen: 2048K->256K(2048K)] 2048K->256K(6144K), 0.0012345 secs] [Times: user=0.01 sys=0.00, real=0.01 secs]
[Full GC (Ergonomics) [PSOldGen: 5120K->4096K(4096K)] 6144K->4096K(6144K), 0.0023456 secs] [Times: user=0.02 sys=0.00, real=0.02 secs]
```

Key Points:

- **PSYoungGen** indicates the young generation space managed by the Parallel GC.
- **PSOldGen** indicates the old generation space managed by the Parallel GC.
- **Times** section shows the user, sys, and real time taken for GC events.

Tuning Parameters:

- **-XX:+UseParallelGC**: Enables the Parallel garbage collector.
- **-XX:ParallelGCThreads=<number_of_threads>**: Sets the number of threads for parallel GC tasks.

**Tuning Tips**:
- Increasing the number of threads can improve throughput but may lead to higher CPU usage.
- Monitor and adjust the balance between application threads and GC threads for optimal performance.

Summary:

The Parallel Garbage Collector is effective for applications with high throughput requirements and can handle large volumes of transactions efficiently. Its multi-threaded approach allows for faster garbage collection and reduced pause times compared to the Serial Garbage Collector.

Would you like to proceed to the **CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) Garbage Collector** next, or is there something specific you want to explore further with the Parallel Garbage Collector?

### 3. CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) Garbage Collector

**Overview**:
The Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) Garbage Collector aims to minimize the pauses caused by garbage collection by performing most of its work concurrently with the application threads. It's designed for applications that require low pause times and can tolerate some degree of concurrent execution overhead.

**How It Works**:
- CMS uses multiple threads to perform garbage collection tasks concurrently with the application.
- It focuses on minimizing pause times by separating the garbage collection process into distinct phases, some of which occur concurrently.

**Phases**:
1. **Initial Mark**:
    - The initial marking of objects is done to identify the roots (live objects). This phase pauses all application threads.

2. **Concurrent Mark**:
    - This phase marks the reachable objects concurrently with the application threads, minimizing the pause time.

3. **Remark**:
    - Finalizes the marking of objects to account for any objects that were modified during the concurrent mark phase. This phase also pauses all application threads.

4. **Concurrent Sweep**:
    - Sweeps and reclaims the memory occupied by dead objects concurrently with the application threads.

5. **Concurrent Reset**:
    - Resets internal data structures in preparation for the next cycle, also done concurrently with the application threads.

**Example**:

Let's consider a Java application using the CMS Garbage Collector. We'll configure the JVM to use the CMS GC and analyze its behavior.

```java
public class CMSGCExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            // Create a large number of objects
            String[] array = new String[10000];
            for (int j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
                array[j] = new String("Object " + j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run the application with the CMS Garbage Collector enabled:
```sh
java -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -Xlog:gc* CMSGCExample
```

**Analyzing GC Logs**:
The GC logs will show how the CMS Garbage Collector is working. You will see entries like:
```
[GC (Allocation Failure) [ParNew: 2048K->256K(2048K)] 2048K->256K(6144K), 0.0012345 secs] [Times: user=0.01 sys=0.00, real=0.01 secs]
[GC (CMS Initial Mark) [1 CMS-initial-mark: 4096K(4096K)] 6144K(6144K), 0.0005678 secs] [Times: user=0.01 sys=0.00, real=0.00 secs]

[CMS-concurrent-reset-start]
[CMS-concurrent-reset: 0.0006789 secs] [Times: user=0.01 sys=0.00, real=0.01 secs]
```

Key Points:

- **ParNew** indicates the young generation space managed by CMS.
- **CMS Initial Mark, CMS Concurrent Mark, CMS Final Remark**: Different phases of CMS GC.
- **Times** section shows the user, sys, and real time taken for GC events.

Tuning Parameters:

- **-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC**: Enables the CMS garbage collector.
- **-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=<percentage>**: Sets the occupancy percentage at which a concurrent collection cycle starts.
- **-XX:+UseParNewGC**: Uses the Parallel New garbage collector for the young generation.

**Tuning Tips**:
- Set `CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction` to a lower value to start collections earlier and avoid long pauses.
- Monitor and adjust the number of threads used by CMS to balance application performance.

Summary:

The CMS Garbage Collector is suitable for applications that require low pause times and can tolerate some degree of concurrent execution overhead. Its concurrent approach helps in minimizing pause times, making it ideal for latency-sensitive applications.

Would you like to move on to the **G1 (Garbage-First) Garbage Collector** next, or is there something specific you want to explore further with the CMS Garbage Collector?

### 4. G1 (Garbage-First) Garbage Collector

**Overview**:
The Garbage-First (G1) Garbage Collector is designed for applications that require predictable pause times and have large heap sizes. G1 is a server-style garbage collector that aims to achieve high throughput with minimal pause times by dividing the heap into regions and collecting garbage in a mixed manner (both young and old generations).

**How It Works**:
- G1 divides the heap into several equal-sized regions.
- It maintains a priority list of regions based on the amount of garbage they contain.
- During garbage collection, G1 focuses on the regions with the most garbage (hence the name "Garbage-First").

**Phases**:
1. **Young Generation Collection**:
    - **Evacuation**: Live objects are evacuated (copied) from the young generation regions to survivor regions or old generation regions.
    - **Parallel Processing**: Uses multiple threads for parallel evacuation.

2. **Concurrent Marking**:
    - **Initial Mark**: A quick pause to mark all live objects reachable from GC roots. This phase pauses all application threads.
    - **Root Region Scanning**: Concurrently scans the old generation regions that were previously young generation regions.
    - **Concurrent Mark**: Concurrently marks live objects throughout the heap, minimizing pause times.
    - **Remark**: Another quick pause to finalize marking of live objects. This phase also pauses all application threads.
    - **Cleanup**: Identifies regions with mostly garbage to prepare them for the next collection.

3. **Mixed Collection**:
    - **Mixed GC**: Collects both young and old generation regions that have been identified to contain a significant amount of garbage.

**Example**:

Let's consider a Java application using the G1 Garbage Collector. We'll configure the JVM to use the G1 GC and analyze its behavior.

```java
public class G1GCExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            // Create a large number of objects
            String[] array = new String[10000];
            for (int j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
                array[j] = new String("Object " + j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run the application with the G1 Garbage Collector enabled:
```sh
java -XX:+UseG1GC -Xlog:gc* G1GCExample
```

**Analyzing GC Logs**:
The GC logs will show how the G1 Garbage Collector is working. You will see entries like:
```
[GC pause (G1 Evacuation Pause) (young) 2048K->256K(2048K), 0.0012345 secs]
[GC concurrent-root-region-scan-start]
[GC concurrent-root-region-scan-end, 0.0023456 secs]
[GC concurrent-mark-start]
[GC concurrent-mark-end, 0.0034567 secs]
[GC remark 2048K->256K(6144K), 0.0005678 secs]
[GC cleanup 4096K->512K(8192K), 0.0012345 secs]
[GC pause (G1 Mixed Pause) 4096K->1024K(8192K), 0.0023456 secs]
```

Key Points:

- **G1 Evacuation Pause**: Indicates a young generation collection.
- **G1 Mixed Pause**: Indicates a mixed collection of young and old generations.
- **Times** section shows the user, sys, and real time taken for GC events.

Tuning Parameters:

- **-XX:+UseG1GC**: Enables the G1 garbage collector.
- **-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=<pause_time_in_ms>**: Sets the target maximum pause time.
- **-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=<size_in_MB>**: Sets the size of the heap regions.

**Tuning Tips**:
- Adjust `MaxGCPauseMillis` to meet desired pause time goals.
- Monitor and tune `G1HeapRegionSize` for optimal performance based on the application's memory footprint.
- Use `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:G1NewSizePercent=<percentage>` to set the size of the young generation.

Summary:

The G1 Garbage Collector is designed for applications with large heap sizes and requirements for predictable pause times. Its region-based approach and mixed collection strategy make it efficient for managing memory with minimal interruptions to application performance.

### 5. ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)

**Overview**:
The Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) is designed for applications that require very low latency and can operate with very large heap sizes. ZGC aims for sub-millisecond pause times by performing most of its work concurrently with the application threads.

**How It Works**:
- ZGC is a concurrent, region-based, and garbage collector. It uses load barriers to achieve low pause times.
- It primarily operates concurrently with the application threads, minimizing stop-the-world pauses.

**Phases**:
1. **Concurrent Marking**:
    - Identifies live objects concurrently with the application threads.
    - Utilizes load barriers to keep track of object references and updates.

2. **Concurrent Relocation**:
    - Moves live objects concurrently to reduce fragmentation and improve memory allocation efficiency.

3. **Concurrent Remapping**:
    - Updates references to relocated objects concurrently.

**Example**:

Let's consider a Java application using the Z Garbage Collector. We'll configure the JVM to use the ZGC and analyze its behavior.

```java
public class ZGCExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            // Create a large number of objects
            String[] array = new String[10000];
            for (int j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
                array[j] = new String("Object " + j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run the application with the Z Garbage Collector enabled:
```sh
java -XX:+UseZGC -Xlog:gc* ZGCExample
```

**Analyzing GC Logs**:
The GC logs will show how the Z Garbage Collector is working. You will see entries like:
```
[GC (Z) [YG occupancy: 1024K (2048K)] 2048K->256K(6144K), 0.0005678 secs]
[GC (Z) [Concurrent cycle 5120K->4096K(8192K), 0.0034567 secs]
[GC (Z) [Remapping 4096K->512K(8192K), 0.0023456 secs]
```

Key Points:

- **ZGC** indicates the use of the Z Garbage Collector.
- **Concurrent cycle**: Shows concurrent phases of ZGC.
- **Times** section shows the user, sys, and real time taken for GC events.

Tuning Parameters:

- **-XX:+UseZGC**: Enables the Z garbage collector.
- **-XX:ZCollectionInterval=<interval_in_ms>**: Sets the interval between concurrent collections.
- **-XX:ZFragmentationLimit=<percentage>**: Sets the fragmentation limit to trigger concurrent garbage collection.

**Tuning Tips**:
- ZGC requires minimal tuning, but monitoring the application's behavior can help ensure it meets latency goals.
- Adjust `ZCollectionInterval` based on application performance requirements.
- Use `ZFragmentationLimit` to manage memory fragmentation effectively.

Summary:

The Z Garbage Collector is ideal for applications that require extremely low latency and can handle very large heap sizes. Its concurrent and region-based approach helps achieve sub-millisecond pause times, making it suitable for latency-sensitive applications.

### 6. Shenandoah Garbage Collector

**Overview**:
The Shenandoah Garbage Collector is designed for applications that require low pause times and have high memory footprint requirements. It aims to reduce pause times by performing most of its work concurrently with the application threads.

**How It Works**:
- Shenandoah uses multiple threads to perform garbage collection tasks concurrently with the application.
- It focuses on minimizing pause times by separating the garbage collection process into distinct phases, most of which occur concurrently.

**Phases**:
1. **Initial Mark**:
    - The initial marking of objects is done to identify the roots (live objects). This phase pauses all application threads briefly.

2. **Concurrent Mark**:
    - This phase marks the reachable objects concurrently with the application threads, minimizing pause time.

3. **Final Mark (Remark)**:
    - Finalizes the marking of objects to account for any objects that were modified during the concurrent mark phase. This phase pauses all application threads briefly.

4. **Concurrent Cleanup**:
    - Cleans up and reclaims the memory occupied by dead objects concurrently with the application threads.

5. **Concurrent Evacuation**:
    - Moves live objects concurrently to reduce fragmentation and improve memory allocation efficiency.

6. **Concurrent Update References**:
    - Updates references to relocated objects concurrently.

**Example**:

Let's consider a Java application using the Shenandoah Garbage Collector. We'll configure the JVM to use the Shenandoah GC and analyze its behavior.

```java
public class ShenandoahGCExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            // Create a large number of objects
            String[] array = new String[10000];
            for (int j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
                array[j] = new String("Object " + j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run the application with the Shenandoah Garbage Collector enabled:
```sh
java -XX:+UseShenandoahGC -Xlog:gc* ShenandoahGCExample
```

**Analyzing GC Logs**:
The GC logs will show how the Shenandoah Garbage Collector is working. You will see entries like:
```
[GC (Shenandoah Pauses) [YC: 2048K->256K(2048K)] 2048K->256K(6144K), 0.0012345 secs]
[GC (Shenandoah Initial Mark) [1 Initial Mark: 4096K(4096K)] 6144K(6144K), 0.0005678 secs] [Times: user=0.01 sys=0.00, real=0.00 secs]
[GC (Shenandoah Concurrent Mark) [concurrent-mark] 0.0056789 secs]
[GC (Shenandoah Final Mark) [final-mark] 2048K->256K(6144K), 0.0012345 secs] [Times: user=0.01 sys=0.00, real=0.01 secs]
[GC (Shenandoah Concurrent Cleanup) [concurrent-cleanup] 0.0012345 secs]
[GC (Shenandoah Concurrent Evacuation) [concurrent-evacuation] 0.0023456 secs]
[GC (Shenandoah Concurrent Update References) [concurrent-update-refs] 0.0012345 secs]
```

Key Points:

- **Shenandoah Pauses**: Indicates brief pauses for various Shenandoah phases.
- **Concurrent phases**: Shows different phases of Shenandoah GC, such as concurrent mark, cleanup, evacuation, and update references.
- **Times** section shows the user, sys, and real time taken for GC events.

Tuning Parameters:

- **-XX:+UseShenandoahGC**: Enables the Shenandoah garbage collector.
- **-XX:ShenandoahGCHeuristics=<heuristic>**: Sets the heuristics for concurrent collection (e.g., adaptive, static).
- **-XX:ShenandoahInitUpdateRefs=<value>**: Sets the initial number of references to update.

**Tuning Tips**:
- Shenandoah is designed for low pause times, so minimal tuning is usually required.
- Monitor the application's performance and adjust heuristics if necessary.

Summary:

The Shenandoah Garbage Collector is suitable for applications that require low pause times and have high memory footprint requirements. Its concurrent approach helps minimize pause times, making it ideal for latency-sensitive applications with large heaps.
